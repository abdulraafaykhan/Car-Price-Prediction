# Car-Price-Prediction
The car price prediction model is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict car prices using various features such as engine size, curb weight, horsepower, car height, car width, wheelbase, car length, and bore 
ratio. The implementation involves data collection, data preprocessing, 
data splitting, model training, model evaluation, deployment, and testing. 
The model has practical implications in the automotive industry, assisting 
in car valuation, pricing, and negotiations. The project has significant 
potential for future development, research, and integration into various 
applications. Despite some limitations, the car price prediction model is a 
valuable tool for making informed decisions about car prices, benefiting 
car dealerships, buyers, and sellers.
